Win32::Console::ANSI version 0.05
=================================

Windows NT/2000/XP does not support ANSI escape sequences in
Win32 Console applications.
This module emulate an ANSI console for the script which uses it.

This module can convert the characters from Windows code page
to DOS code page (the so-called ANSI to OEM conversion).
This conversion permits the display of the accented characters
in the console like in a Windows-based editor.

It works on all Win32 platforms.

Caution: this module is still in beta stage; don't use it in a
production script.

All suggestion or remark is welcome.
